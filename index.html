    <p>Last Christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day 
You gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special </p>
<p>Last Christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day 
You gave it away (you gave it away)
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special (special)</p>
<p>Once bitten and twice shy 
I keep my distance 
But you still catch my eye 
Tell me baby 
Do you recognize me? 
Well 
It's been a year 
It doesn't surprise me
